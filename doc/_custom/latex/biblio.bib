  abstract = {A new formulation of the Fourier modal method (FMM) that applies the correct rules of Fourier factorization for crossed surface-relief gratings is presented. The new formulation adopts a general nonrectangular Cartesian coordinate system, which gives the FMM greater generality and in some cases the ability to save computer memory and computation time. By numerical examples, the new FMM is shown to converge much faster than the old FMM. In particular, the FMM is used to produce well-converged numerical results for metallic crossed gratings. In addition, two matrix truncation schemes, the parallelogramic truncation and a new circular truncation, are considered. Numerical experiments show that the former is superior.},

  abstract = {We have developed a general methodology for computing electromagnetic (EM) fields and forces in matter, based on solving the macroscopic Maxwell's equations numerically in real space and adopting the time-averaged Maxwell stress tensor formalism. We can treat both dielectric and metallic systems characterized by a local frequency-dependent dielectric function, and of any size and geometry in principle. In this paper, we are particularly interested in calculating forces on nanostructures, induced by a beam of monochromatic light (such as a laser). The motivation behind this particular direction is the facilitation of self assembly in colloidal systems with the aim of aiding the fabrication of photonic crystals. We first look at two homogeneous systems: a half space and a layer. In passing from a low-{$\epsilon$} to a high-{$\epsilon$} medium, the light beam always attracts the interface (i.e., the surface force is negative). Thus the surfaces of two liquids separated by a layer of lower {$\epsilon$} will generally be attracted towards each other, whereas for solids the total force must also be negative. This condition is not satisfied for the EM field of a traveling wave, but may be fulfilled for an evanescent wave. Thus, by shining evanescent light in the region between two solid bodies an attraction between them may be induced. We then study the EM forces induced by a laser beam on a three-dimensional crystal of dielectric spheres of GaP in air. At wavelengths comparable to the lattice constant, multiple scattering effects tune in: band gaps, Bragg scattering. But in all these cases the incident beam induces positive pressure on (and between) the spheres. Much more interesting is the regime where the radiation couples to the EM eigenmodes supported by isolated spheres (Mie resonances). These modes are analogous to electronic orbitals and, like their electronic counterparts, can form bonding and antibonding interactions between neighboring spheres. By irradiating the system with light at the bonding frequency an attractive interaction is induced between the spheres. For moderate intensities of the incident radiation these forces can overcome all other interactions present (gravitational, thermal, and Van der Waals) and may provide the main mechanism for formation of stable crystal structures in colloidal systems.},

  abstract = {We formulate a scattering-matrix-based numerical method to calculate the optical transmission properties and quasiguided eigenmodes in a two-dimensionally periodic photonic crystal slab (PCS) of finite thickness. The square symmetry (point group C4v) is taken for the illustration of the method, but it is quite general and works for any point group symmetry for one-dimensional (1D) and 2D PCS's. We show that the appearance of well-pronounced dips in the transmission spectra of a PCS is due to the interaction with resonant waveguide eigenmodes in the slab. The energy position and width of the dips in transmission provide information on the frequency and inverse radiative lifetime of the quasiguided eigenmodes. We calculate the energies, linewidths, and electromagnetic fields of such quasiguided eigenmodes, and analyze their symmetry and optical activity. The electromagnetic field in such modes is resonantly enhanced, which opens possibilities for use in creating resonant enhancement of different nonlinear effects.},

  abstract = {We present a three-dimensional analysis of guided resonances in photonic crystal slab structures that leads to a new understanding of the complex spectral properties of such systems. Specifically, we calculate the dispersion diagrams, the modal patterns, and transmission and reflection spectra of these resonances. From these calculations, a key observation emerges involving the presence of two temporal pathways for transmission and reflection processes. Using this insight, we introduce a general physical model that explains the essential features of complex spectral properties. Finally, we show that the quality factors of these resonances are strongly influenced by the symmetry of the modes and the strength of the index modulation.},
